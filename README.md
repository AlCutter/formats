## Overview

This repository contains descriptions and supporting implementations for some
reusable formats related to transparent logs.

While it's not in any way a requirement that transparent systems use these formats,
adopting them will enable a certain amount of interoperability and shared infrastructure
for basic tooling such as logs and witnesses.
